  09/30/92 -
              CHANGED - $D (REXX EXEC) - IT CAN NOW DISPLAY MORE STUFF.
              ADDED   - JESXIT05 - ASM - JES2 COMMAND EXIT.  SEE $INDEX
                        FOR DOCUMENTATION.

  10/20/93 -
              CHANGED - $D (REXX EXEC) - ADD THE DISPLAY OF LPALIST AND
                        MORE STUFF.
              CHANGED - FIND - ASM - CHANGES TO REPLACE ALL 'TPUT' AND
                        'TGET' WITH 'PUTLINE' AND 'GETLINE'.  'TPUT'
                        WILL NOT WORK IF TMP IS RUN IN BATCH MODE.
              ADDED   - SEEK - ASM - TSO COMMAND TO SEARCH FOR LOAD
                        MODULE IN LNKLST, LPA AND/OR STEPLIB (TASKLIB).
              ADDED   - $LLACOPY - ASM - BATCH PROGRAM TO DO A REFRESH
                        OF A PARTICULAR MODULE.
              ADDED   - #LLACOPY - JCL - JCL TO RUN PROGRAM $LLACOPY.

  10/05/94 -
              ADDED   - $6 (REXX EXEC) - EVERY SO OFTEN, YOU NEED TO ACCESS
                        A LOADLIB AND EXECUTE TSO COMMANDS OUT OF IT.  RATHER
                        THAN GETTING OUT OF SPF, ALLOCATE A NEW ISPLLIB AND THEN
                        GET BACKIN, JUST EXECUTE THIS EXEC AND VOILA !!
              ADDED   - $6DOC - DOC - INSTALL DOC FOR $6.
              ADDED   - ISRTSOA - PANEL - ISPF PANEL TO BE USED WITH $D.  THIS
                        IS THE MODIFIED ISRTSOA (IBM).
              ADDED   - $VSAMIDX (REXX EXEC) - EXEC TO CALCULATE THE OPTIMUM
                        NUMBER OF INDEX BUFFERS TO BE SPECIFIED FOR A VSAM KSDS.
                        THIS WILL BE GOOD FOR ANY RANDOM ACCESS AGAINST THIS
                        DATA SET.
              ADDED   - $VSDOC - DOC - INSTALL DOC FOR $VSAMIDX.
              ADDED   - $VSIDX01 - PANEL - ISPF PANEL USED BY $VSAMIDX.
              ADDED   - JSTAT - ASM - BATCH PROGRAM TO CHECK AND SEE IF A JOB
                        (OR STC OR TSU) IS CURRENTLY RUNNING (USING THE 'STATUS'
                        FUNCTION OF JES2).  IF IT IS FOUND, THEN WTO'S WILL BE
                        DONE USING CONTROL CARDS IN 'FND'.  OTHERWISE, CONTROL
                        CARDS FROM 'NOTFND' DDNAME WILL BE USED BY WTO'S.
                        IF 'RRFND' AND 'RRNOTFND' ARE USED, A WTOR WILL BE DONE
                        AFTER THE WTO'S TO GIVE THE OPERATOR A CHANCE TO DO
                        SOMETHING ELSE BEFORE THE REPLY.  OF COURSE, NONE OF
                        THE DDNAMES HAS TO BE PRESENT, IN WHICH CASE, THE
                        APPROPRIATE RETURN CODE WILL BE ISSUED BASED ON THE
                        JOB STATUS.
                        NOTE THAT SINCE THIS PROGRAM DOES NOT GO THROUGH
                        THE ASVT, AND THEREFORE DOES WORK IN A JES2 SHARED
                        SPOOL ENVIRONMENT.
              ADDED   - JSTAT# - JCL USED TO ASSEMBLE MODULE JSTAT.  THIS
                        PROGRAM REQUIRES APF AUTHORIZATION, AND THEREFORE
                        NEEDS TO BE LINKED (OR COPIED) TO AN APF LIBRARY.
              ADDED   - JSTAT$ - TEST JCL TO RUN JSTAT.

  12/07/94 -
              ADDED   - $JAD (REXX EXEC) - TO DISPLAY ADDRESS SPACES INFO,
                        I.E. TCB, SRBTIME, EXCP COUNT, TOTAL PROCESSOR STORAGE,
                        REAL, EXPANDED STORAGE, ETC ...  A PLOT OF STORAGE
                        DISTRIBUTION BASED ON UIC CAN BE DISPLAYED FOR SELECTED
                        ADDRESS SPACE.
              ADDED   - $JAD... - PANELS - ISPF PANELS USED BY $JAD.
              ADDED   - $JAD# - DOC - INSTALLATION INSTRUCTION FOR $JAD.

  03/06/95 -
              CHANGED - $JAD (REXX EXEC) - TO ADD DISPLAY OF SRM CPU BUSY PCT.
              CHANGED - $JAD PANELS - TO SUPPORT THE ACTION BAR SELECTION ON THE
                        MAIN DISPLAY.
              CHANGED - $BLDLIST - MACROS - TO PROVIDE 31-BIT ADDR SUPPORT.
              ADDED   - $JADPGM - ASM - THIS IS THE ASM VERSION OF $JAD
                        ***** VERY FAST COMPARED TO $JAD *****
              ADDED   - @JADPGM - JCL - USED TO ASSEMBLE $JADPGM.

  08/08/95 -
              CHANGED - JESXIT05 - ASM - TO ADD DISPLAY OF IPL TYPE ON ($Q
                        SYSTEM) AND ALSO ADD $QDSN=XXXX.
              CHANGED - $LLACOPY - ASM - ADD BETTER REPORTING.
              CHANGED - #LLACOPY - JCL - TO ADD SYSIN & SYSPRINT.

  02/10/97 -
              CHANGED - $D (REXX EXEC) - CLEAN UP THE CODE.  ADD DISPLAY FOR
                        SYSTEM STORAGE, IPL LOADPARM IN '$D SYS'.  CHECK FOR
                        'DYNAMIC' APF IN '$D APF'.  ADD NEW FUNCTION TO DISPLAY
                        NUCLEUS MAP AS '$D NUC', DISPLAY CHPIDS AS '$D CHP' AND
                        '$D ALL'.
              ADDED   - $DO - EDIT MACRO (REXX) - TO SYNTAX CHECK A REXX EXEC
                        FOR DO/SELECT-END PAIRINGS.  ANY HANGING 'DO/SELECT' OR
                        'END' WILL BE DETECTED AND FLAGGED.  THIS IS GOOD FOR
                        ANYONE CODING REXX EXECS WITH A LOT OF 'DO/SELECT' AND
                        'END'.  THIS EDIT MACRO ONLY PRODUCES INFORMATIONAL
                        MESSAGES AND DOES NOT UPDATE THE EXEC ITSELF.
              ADDED   - $CKOUT (REXX EXEC) - TO DISPLAY PERTINENT INFO ABOUT
                        YOUR TSO SESSION AND/OR BATCH TMP.  I USED THIS TO
                        VERIFY OUT SMF/JES2 EXITS WHEN WE WENT TO MVS 5.2.2.
                        QUITE INTERESTING LITTLE EXEC.
              CHANGED - DYNALIST - ASM - TO USE THE NEW UCBSCAN SERVICES IN
                        MVS 5.X.X.  ALSO CHANGE ALL TPUTS & TGETS TO PUTLINES &
                        GETLINES SO IT CAN BE RUN UNDER BATCH TMP.
              ADDED   - $CMDPFX - ASM - TO ASSIGN A COMMAND PREFIX TO A MVS
                        IMAGE IN A PARALLEL SYSPLEX.  RATHER THAN USING THE
                        'ROUTE' COMMAND, YOU CAN USE THIS PREFIX FOR ROUTING
                        A COMMAND TO THE APPROPRIATE SYSTEM.
              ADDED   - $MPFREPL - ASM - A GENERALIZED MPF EXIT.  THE MESSAGES
                        BEING HANDLED ARE CODED USING AN IN-LINE MACRO.
                        PROCESSING CAN ALSO BE LIMITED TO MESSAGES PRODUCED BY
                        CERTAIN JOBNAMES SPECIFIED BY THIS MACRO.
              CHANGED - JESXIT05 - ASM - ADDS THE DISPLAY OF LOADPARM IN
                        $QSYSTEM.  ALSO PUT OUT MESSAGES INDICATING DYNAMIC
                        APF BEING ACTIVE IF THAT'S THE CASE.
              ADDED   - $VSAMIXA (REXX EXEC) - MODIFIED VERSION OF $VSAMIDX SO
                        IT WILL RUN WITH DFSMS 1.X.
  12/10/98 -
              ADDED   - $CAL - CLIST (EXEC) - WRITTEN IN TSO REXX.  THIS EXEC
                        DISPLAYS A QUICK POP-UP CALENDAR USING ISPF PANEL.
                        IT ALSO DISPLAYS THE LAST AND NEXT MONTH AS WELL.
              CHANGED - $D (REXX EXEC) - ADDED SOME MORE DISPLAYS.  ALSO INCLUDE
                        THE DATE CONVERSION ROUTINE.
              ADDED   - $DATE - CLIST (EXEC) - WRITTEN IN TSO REXX.  THIS REXX
                        FUNCTION DOES DATE CONVERSIONS, INCLUDING RELATIVE DATE
                        USED FOR CALCULATION.
              ADDED   - $PARM (REXX EXEC) - CLIST (EXEC) - WRITTEN IN TSO REXX.
                        THIS EXEC TAKES IN THE PARMS AND DOES SUBSTITUTION ON
                        THE INPUT CARDS (FROM DDNAME INPUT) TO PRODUCE OUTPUT
                        DATA FOR SUBSEQUENT USAGE.  SEVERAL RESERVED SYMBOLS
                        WILL BE SUBSTITUTED AS WELL, I.E. ~JOBNAME~, ~SYSID~.
                        REXX FUNCTIONS WILL ALSO BE EVALUATED TO PRODUCE THE
                        OUTPUT IF CODED (THIS CAN BE JUST ANOTHER EXTERNAL REXX
                        FUNCTION LIKE $DATE)
              ADDED   - $Q - EDIT MACRO (REXX) - THIS MACRO TAKES A PARM AS A
                        TSO COMMAND TO BE ISSUED AND THE OUTPUT WILL BE TRAPPED
                        AND DISPLAYED AS ISPF EDIT NOTE LINES.
              ADDED   - $SAVE - EDIT MACRO (REXX) - THIS MACRO SAVES DATA BEING
                        EDITED BY DOING UPDATE IN PLACE FOR A PDS MEMBER.
                        EXTREMELY USEFUL IF SYS1.PROCLIB IS FULL, AND YOU JUST
                        NEED TO MAKE MINIMUM CHANGES TO A PROC (UNLESS YOU WANT
                        TO GO AHEAD AND COMPRESS IT RIGHT THEN AND THERE ...)
              ADDED   - $WHOHAS (REXX EXEC) - CLIST (EXEC) - THIS REXX EXEC WILL
                        LIST THE ACCESS LISTS FOR RACF DATA SET PROFILES FOUND
                        UNDER DSN*.**.  THIS FUNCTION IS VERY MUCH SIMILAR TO
                        'TSS WHOHAS DSN' COMMAND UNDER TOP SECRET.  IF THE EXEC
                        IS RUN IN BATCH, THE RACF COMMANDS USED TO RE-BUILD ALL
                        OF THE PROFILES AS DISPLAYED IN THE OUTPUT IS ALSO
                        PRODUCED.
              ADDED   - $X - EDIT MACRO (REXX) - THIS MACRO READS THE MEMBER
                        BEING EDITED AND EXECUTES IT AS A CLIST/EXEC.  EXECUTION
                        PARMS ARE ALLOWED AS WELL.  THIS DOES NOT REQUIRED THE
                        MEMBER TO BE SAVED FIRST.  EXTREMELY USEFUL IF YOU'RE
                        DOING A LOT OF CLIST/EXEC CODING AND DEBUGGING.
  12/01/00 -
              CHANGED - SEEK - ASM - TO DISPLAY THE CURRENT LINKLST SET.
              ADDED   - ENQMON - ASM - TO DISPLAY AND LOG ENQ CONTENTIONS UNDER
                        GRS. THIS PROGRAM TRIES TO MIMICK WHAT MIM DOES WITH
                        THE EXCEPTION OF JOB REQUEUE FUNCTION.  SEE PROGRAM
                        COMMENTS FOR DETAIL.
              CHANGED - $D (REXX EXEC) - TO CORRECTLY DISPLAY THE CURRENT
                        LINKLIST SET.
              ADDED   - $CPU (REXX EXEC) - THIS IS A CPU MONITOR DISPLAY EXEC.
                        THE CPU UTILIZATION IS DISPLAYED IN GRAPHICAL FORMAT
                        USING ISPF PANELS WITH DYNAMIC COLOR.  THE DATA IS
                        WRAPPED AROUND ON THE SCREEN FOR COMPARISON.  PRETTY
                        COLORS !!!!
              ADDED   - $INFO (REXX EXEC).  THIS IS A GENERAL SRM INFO DISPLAY
                        EXEC.  THE CPU UTILIZATION PLUS ALL OTHER SRM
                        INDICATORS ARE SHOWN. ANY EXCEPTION CONDITION WILL
                        CHANGE EITHER SOME DISPLAY COLORS OR TEXT DISPLAY.
                        SOME OF THE INFO INCLUDES PAGE FAULT RATE, MIGR AGE,
                        AFQ, UIC, ETC...  THE CPU UTIL IS ALSO DISPLAYED IN A
                        GRAPHICAL FORMAT.  AGAIN, PRETTY COLORS !!!
